Introducing Melo-N – where your favorite tunes get a whole new vibe! Melo-N combines "melody" and "Novate" to bring you a fun way to switch up your music.

Here's the deal: You pick a song and a genre, and we do the rest. We keep the lyrics and melody intact while changing up the music style. It's like listening to your favourite songs in a whole new light!

How do we do it? We use cool tech tools like Spleeter to separate vocals from instruments, so we can tweak things just right. Then, with the help of the MusicGen API, we switch up the genre to give your song a fresh spin. Once everything's mixed up, we deliver your custom version – ready for you to enjoy.

Melo-N is all about exploring new sounds and having fun with your music. Whether you want to rock out to a country beat or chill with a pop vibe, Melo-N lets you mix it up however you like.

So, get ready to rediscover your favourite tunes with Melo-N – where music meets innovation, and every listen is an adventure!
